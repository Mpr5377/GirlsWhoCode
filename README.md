# A Quick Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to Girls Who Code!! 
My name is Madelyn Forrester and I am a computer science major at the University of Maryland (UMD). I love computer science, 
software development, and problem solving. Throughout the semester, I hope this ciriculum will provide you basic programming
skills and a new found love for computer science. The world we live in runs through computer systems, and understanding how 
tools of society are built, will give you a better understanding of the technology you interact with everyday. 

## What does coding mean? 

The link below is short clip that describes a high level overview of what the term "coding" means. This video describes that code "is a precise set of instructions a computer can understand". Throughout this course we will be attempting to write instructions for our computers. We will be using the computer language named Python to write our instructions.

### Recipes

The video also mentioned that programs are similar to recipeies and the computer is following the instructions layed out in the code. In order for our computers to perform a given task, we must write incredibly specific instructions. If the programmer forgets to include instructions, the computer will not be able to understand the instructions and will not be able to perform the desired action. Below is a hilarious video of a father attempting to show his children the impact of unspecific instructions. As you can see, the father in the video shows his children that making assumptions can lead to misinterpretation.
