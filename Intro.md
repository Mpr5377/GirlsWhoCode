# A Quick Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to Girls Who Code!! 
My name is Madelyn Forrester and I am a computer science major at the University of Maryland (UMD). I love computer science, 
software development, and problem solving. Throughout the semester, I hope this ciriculum will provide you basic programming
skills and a new found love for computer science. The world we live in runs through computer systems, and understanding how 
tools of society are built, will give you a better understanding of the technology you interact with everyday.
